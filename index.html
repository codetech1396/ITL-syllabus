OVERVIEW 

 
Introduction to Lawyering: Next Generation Lawyering is a two-credit course that introduces 
you to the study of law, the practice of law, the business of law, and the technology that drives 
modern legal practice. The course meets throughout your first year of law school, with most 
meetings occurring during the week preceding your regular courses, known at the law school as 
“compressed course” week. In the Fall semester, the focus of the course will be on introducing 
you to law school, the practice of law, legal job search skills and the opportunities a J.D. can 
provide. In the Spring, our focus will shift to integrating legal skills and legal technology.   
 
1. Required Texts and Other Materials. 
 

(A) JDEdge by Access Lex 
 
(B) ROADMAP THE LAW STUDENT’S GUIDE TO MEANINGFUL EMPLOYMENT, THIRD 
EDITION BY NEIL HAMILTON. 
 

(C) Additional Materials: Other necessary materials are available to you on the Canvas 
site as posted documents or links to documents, which you will access through the 
“Modules” tab on the Canvas site.  
 

2. Course Objective and Goals 
 
Building on complementary courses – including JD Edge, Legal Research, and Legal Writing, 
Introduction to Lawyering introduces you to law school and the legal profession. It aims to 
establish a foundation for your near- and long-term success as a law student and a 
practicing lawyer. Our first goal is to help you achieve in law school, and the beginning of 
the course will set you up for success in the classroom. Our second goal is to help you 
navigate legal practice and find a meaningful and rewarding career. Our third goal is to 
equip you with the necessary skills for success in growing and building your career within a 
rapidly changing professional landscape. Finally, we aim to ensure that you have core 
competency in the most important legal technology tools that will shape your practice.   


 
The specific objectives for this two-part course are to improve your knowledge of and skills 
in four main areas: 
 

(1) Understanding, embracing, and succeeding in core law school skills (including issue 
spotting and analysis; critical reading; and basic client advising); 
 

(2) Understanding the operation and structure of the legal profession, including the 
importance of networking, client relationships, and client management; 

 
(3) Understanding and applying basic legal skills in the areas of negotiation and dispute 
resolution;  

 
(4) Understanding and using basic legal technology tools to facilitate legal writing, legal 
research, legal analysis; and the practice of and business of law 

 
3. Learning Outcomes. 
 
You will understand the law school’s unique educational environment, including recognizing 
how it differs from undergraduate or other previous educational experiences, and learn 
practical skills to help you succeed. You will also understand how legal education fits within the 
larger legal profession and, in all environments, grasp how to leverage legal education, 
networking, and career development skills for long-term success. 
 
You will demonstrate knowledge of these concepts through in class participation, written 
assignments, and the final exam (which will take place after the spring compressed course 
week). Students will integrate their knowledge of these concepts through simulation exercises 
and reflection papers. To improve their readiness for the legal job market, students are required 
to write a self-assessment of their career development, a cover letter, and a resume.  
 
4. Evaluation and Receiving Credit for this Course. 
 
This is a pass/fail course. To receive credit for this course, you must do the following: 
 

• not miss more than one scheduled class meeting per semester 

• Successfully complete all written assignments 

• Consistently be prepared when called upon in class and/or when participating in small-
group exercises 

• Achieve a satisfactory score on the final examination in spring 2026 

• Participate in good faith in all classroom activities and exercises 
 
Students who do not satisfy each of the above requirements will either need to complete 
additional assignments or repeat this course the following year to earn credit for the course.   


 
Although this is a pass/fail course, each professor will award a small percentage of “S+” grades 
at the end of the semester to students who excel in the above categories. 
 
5. Course Evaluations. 
 
Students are expected to provide professional and respectful feedback on the quality of 
instruction in this course by completing course evaluations online via GatorEvals. Guidance on 
how to give feedback in a professional and respectful manner is available 
at https://gatorevals.aa.ufl.edu/students/. Students will be notified when the evaluation period 
opens and can complete evaluations through the email they receive from GatorEvals in their 
Canvas course menu under GatorEvals OR via https://ufl.bluera.com/ufl/. Summaries of course 
evaluation results are available to students at https://gatorevals.aa.ufl.edu/public- results/. 
 
6. Course Policies. 
 

a. Attendance Requirements. Pursuant to law school and ABA regulations, 
students are required to attend class regularly. Absences for observance 
of religious holidays are excused. Please let us know, via email, if you 
plan to miss class for this reason only. Otherwise, you are allowed to miss 
a total of 1 class period.  We will not issue warnings—it is your 
responsibility to keep track of your absences. Upon missing more than 
four hours of instructional time, you may receive a failing grade for the 
course. Extraordinary situations, personal illnesses, and not-cleared 
COVID statuses should be addressed to the staff at Student Life, who will 
handle attendance accommodations. 

 
b. Class Participation. We expect you to come to class having read the 
material, completing any required pre-class assignments (such as 
assigned worksheets or videos), and prepare to engage in discussions 
or exercises. Being unprepared when called upon or failing to 
participate in any assignment or exercise, whether graded or non-
graded, may affect whether you receive credit for this course. 

 

c. Written Assignments. To receive credit for this course, you must 
successfully complete the three written assignments. Each assignment 
is due by the start of class on the day for which it is assigned. These 
written assignments are: (1) a resume; (2) a cover letter; (3) a 
statement of career development. You will find the instructions for 
each of the written assignments on the Canvas site (under the 
“Assignments” tab on the left hand side.) You are required to submit 
all of the assignments on Canvas. You also need to email your resume 
to your assigned Career and Professional Development Advisor. The 
length of the statement of career development should be 
approximately two pages. 
 

As the culminating project for the class, you will take an exam that requires you to 
review a case file and prepare an analysis, respond to short answer questions and 
answer multiple-choice questions.  

 

d. Classroom Behavior. You are all bound by the University Student Code 
of Conduct, the College of Law Honor Code, and the rules for this 
course. Proper conduct in the classroom is necessary to allow 
everyone to participate in, to derive benefit from, and enjoy the class. 
Any unprofessional, disrespectful, harassing, disruptive, or distracting 
conduct that has a negative effect on the classroom atmosphere is 
prohibited. Unless required for a course activity, you are not allowed 
to use a laptop computer during class or access the internet or any 
electronically-stored information using any device (including phones) 
during class without the professor’s permission. Except as provided 
below concerning in-class recordings, all electronic devices should be 
turned off during class. Other inappropriate classroom conduct will be 
handled on a case-by-case basis.  

 

The conduct described in this paragraph may result in administrative removal from 
the course. 
 
Please arrive at class on time. If you arrive more than 10 minutes late without prior 
permission, you may be counted as absent. 
 

e. Statement Related to Accommodations for Students with Disabilities. 
Students requesting classroom accommodation must first register with 
the Office of Disability Resources. The UF Office of Disability Resources 
will provide documentation to the student who must then provide this 
documentation to the Law School Office of Student Affairs when 
requesting accommodation. 

 
f. Discourse and Classroom Ethos: As a law student and future lawyer, it 
is important that you be able to engage in rigorous discourse and 
critical evaluation while also demonstrating civility and respect for 
others. This is even more important in the case of controversial issues 
and other topics that may elicit strong emotions. 

 

As a group, we come from a variety of racial, ethnic, sexual, religious, and political 
lines. As we enter one of the great learning spaces in the world—the law school 
classroom—and develop our unique personality as a class section, we encourage each 
of us to: 



• commit to self-examination of our values and assumptions 

• speak honestly, thoughtfully, and respectfully 

• listen carefully and respectfully 

• reserve the right to change our mind and allow for others to do the same 

• allow ourselves and each other to verbalize ideas and to push the 
boundaries of logic and reasoning both as a means of exploring our beliefs 
as well as a method of sharpening our skills as lawyers 

 
7. Technology:  You are required to bring your laptop to each class.  You are prohibited 
from using any form of Artificial Intelligence when completing any assignments or class 
work unless explicitly permitted by the professor(s).  Failure to abide by this policy will be 
deemed a violation of the UF Honor Code. 
 
8. UF’s Academic Policies &amp; Resources:  Information about UF’s Academic Policies and 
Resources can be found at https://go.ufl.edu/syllabuspolicies.

health counselor, Ritzy Ettinger, at rettinger@ufl.edu.  You can also reach out to Student Life at
